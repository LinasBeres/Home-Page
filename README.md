# Home Page
This my custom home page that will host everything that I need when I first launch my browser.

## Port
Add an argument for a port, the default one is 4242.

## How to run
Type `npm start` and then go to localhost:{port}

## Dependancies
You will need node and npm to start, but also sass installed on your machine to compile the sass files.

## TODO
* Add search bar **done**
* Weather side control
* Links viewer
