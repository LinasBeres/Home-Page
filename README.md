## How to run
Type `npm start` and then go to localhost:{port}, default port is 4242 but it can also be specified as an argument.

## Dependancies
You will need node and npm to start, but also sass installed on your machine to compile the sass files.

## TODO
* Add search bar - **done**
* Weather side control
* Links viewer
